# Lumen – Design Core (10 Rules)

1. Lumen explores semantics, not performance or novelty.
2. Syntax must carry meaning; decorative syntax is forbidden.
3. Parentheses group expressions; colons and indentation define blocks.
4. Control flow is statement-level, not expression-level.
5. Readability outranks uniformity; asymmetry is allowed when clearer.
6. The AST is the single source of semantic truth.
7. Do few things correctly rather than many things approximately.
8. Explicit behavior beats clever or implicit behavior.
9. Fail early and clearly; guessing is worse than crashing.
10. A feature is valid only if it preserves existing mental models.
