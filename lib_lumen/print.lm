# Lumen Standard Library: print() function
#
# This library implements the print() function, which layers on top of write().
# print() adds newline semantics to write(), establishing a clear layering:
# print = write + newline

# print(x) - User-facing output with newline
# Writes x to stdout followed by a newline.
# Implemented by calling write(x) then write("\n").
fn print(x)
    write(x)
    write("\n")
    none
